# Retail Analytics Dashboard with BigQuery & Power BI

## 📊 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **SQL (BigQuery)** and **Power BI** can be combined to build an **end-to-end retail analytics solution**. Using a Kaggle dataset, the goal was to simulate a real-world business case where transactional data is stored in the cloud (BigQuery) and then transformed into **interactive dashboards** in Power BI for insights.

The project highlights skills in **data engineering, data modeling, and business intelligence reporting**—a portfolio piece designed to showcase practical analytics capabilities to recruiters and employers.

## 📑 Dataset

The dataset was sourced from **Kaggle**:
👉 [E-commerce Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

It contains **orders, products, users, and distribution center data**. These tables were imported into **Google BigQuery** for querying and integrated into Power BI for visualization.
